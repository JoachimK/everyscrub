Everyscrub for Brackets
==========
Everything's a scrubber! Cmd/Ctrl + drag on any number or hex color to scrub its value. In "Live development" mode, the browser preview will update in real time while you're dragging.

You can also tap Shift+Alt+Up/Down to "nudge" the value in individual increments.

Works with any number in CSS, LESS, and JavaScript. Also works with 3- or 6-digit hex colors in CSS and LESS (darkens/lightens the color). Just hold down Cmd (Mac) or Ctrl (Win), click on the number in your source code, and drag the mouse horizontally.
